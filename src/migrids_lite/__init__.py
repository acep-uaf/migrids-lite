MiGRIDS Lite - a simple, hourly energy balance modeling package for Python
========================================================================

MiGRIDS Lite is a pandas-based Python package to handle hourly energy balance 
calculations for a microgrid. It takes into consideration generator minimum
loads, different battery charge and discharge rates, and spinning reserve 
requirements, among others. Compared to MiGRIDS, Lite is easier to learn,
less complex, and requires much less technical knowledge.

Main Features
-------------
   - User definable generator fuel curves and minimum operating load
   - Battery storage consideration
   - Customizable spinning reserve requirements
   - Calculation of time shifting of generators due to utilization of storage
   - pandas-based, so pandas utilities are included
